Describe the problem:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?

# Solution:


def my_function():
    for i in range(1, 21):  # Change range to include 20
        if i == 20:
            print("You got it")
